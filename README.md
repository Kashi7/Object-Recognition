# Object recognition using cifar10 dataset
I have used the All-CNN network published in the 2015 ICLR paper, "Striving For Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net". This paper can be found at the following link:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6806.pdf
The dataset I have used is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
